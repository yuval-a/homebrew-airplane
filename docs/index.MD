# üõ´ Airplane - an AI driven terminal REPL
Ask your OS questions, give it instructions - get back direct OS commands to run (with your approval) to achieve your results.

`Airplane` is designed to be straighforward, fast and simple.
It integrates with your existing shell, giving you the ability to write prompts in a natural language directly in the command-line, by prefixing your input with the colon character (`:`).

# Examples for things you can ask
* `:show environment variables`
* `:information about my memory`
* `:information about my cpus`
* `:create a directory called ‚Äúdemo‚Äù, give it full file permissions and change to it`
* `:create a text file with the lyrics of the song Hava Nagila`
* `:show all ports and their listening processes`
* `:restart nginx`

# Features
